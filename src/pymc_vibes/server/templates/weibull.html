        Each gray curve represents a plausible probability distribution for the
        <strong>time-to-failure</strong>, drawn from the posterior. The
        horizontal axis, <strong>Duration</strong>, represents time (e.g.,
        hours, days, cycles), and the vertical axis represents the probability
        of a failure occurring at that specific time. The variation among these
        curves illustrates the uncertainty in our estimates of the
        <code>α</code> (shape) and <code>β</code> (scale) parameters.

        The <strong>dashed red line</strong> serves as a reference, showing the
        distribution for a constant failure rate (an

        uses the median posterior value for the scale parameter <code>β</code>.

        This model accounts for <strong>censored data</strong>—cases where a
        failure has not been observed by the end of the observation period.
        These data points (shown in orange in the "Raw Event Data" chart)
        provide crucial information that the time-to-failure is
        <em>at least</em> as long as the observed duration. The shape parameter,
        <code>α</code>, tells us about the failure rate over time:

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-1 ml-4">
        <li>
          <code>α > 1</code>: Increasing failure rate (wear-out). Components are
          more likely to fail as they age.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>α = 1</code>: Constant failure rate (random failures, as in the
          Exponential distribution).
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>α < 1</code>: Decreasing failure rate (infant mortality). Early
          failures are more common.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-1">
        If you see many traces with peaks later than the red reference line, it
        suggests the data provides evidence for an <code>α > 1</code>,
        indicating a wear-out phenomenon.
